His father, Floyd Mayweather Sr., was a former welterweight contender who fought Hall of Famer Sugar Ray Leonard. His uncles Jeff and Roger Mayweather were professional boxers, with Roger – his future trainer – winning two world championships.\n\nMayweather was born into poverty and had a difficult childhood. His mother was addicted to drugs, and his father was incarcerated for drug trafficking when Floyd was young. He often lived without electricity or running water in their home. Despite these hardships, boxing became his refuge.\n\nAs an amateur, Mayweather had an outstanding record of 84-8. He won three Michigan Golden Gloves championships (1993, 1994, 1996), the 1993 National PAL Championship, and the 1994 National Golden Gloves Championship. His crowning amateur achievement came at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he won a bronze medal in the featherweight division, losing a controversial semifinal decision to Bulgaria's Serafim Todorov."
